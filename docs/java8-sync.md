# Java 8 / Spigot 1.8 synchronization

This is a behavior-aware compatibility backport, not a replacement with current main.
The legacy public packages, configuration defaults, user data formats and proxy payloads
remain in use. It does not claim feature parity with main.

## Immutable comparison inputs

| Repository | Clean 1.8 branch start | Main comparison |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AdvancedCore | `d4a8f667d91e7121a5e0929a0e16cd615556f00d` | `6390c1cab41bd4d7683c7df88dd36537c8c7861e` |
| VotingPlugin | `1b1e6d7d47a3d0af2ad5ede79ae3436c7aaddf73` | `834bcb84a59b6da40640eac83c20fd97ad1d64c9` |

The forks contain independently copied/adapted releases, rather than a continuous main
ancestry. The last represented releases are AdvancedCore 3.7.17
(`9e89ad0bfe4a0472f2fb01737546b024f4be87f0`) and VotingPlugin 6.18.7
(`caa70583638dcfebce67c0a0019daf1cd16402b5`). The retained
`VotingPlugin/src.main.java` tree is not an active Maven source root; it was not deleted.

## Dependency and platform decisions

Build with an actual Java 8 JDK. Test and production dependency base classes must be
compatible with Java 8. Artifact tests inspect the actual shaded jar and independently
load its Hikari pool and reflective scheduler classes; a compiler target alone is insufficient.
Java 8 ignores multi-release entries under `META-INF/versions/`.

The unavailable SimpleAPI `0.0.7-SNAPSHOT` is replaced by the fixed `0.0.7` release.
Its modern pool/Folia classes are excluded, and the existing Java 8 HikariCP 3.4.1 is
used. SLF4J API and binding are both 1.7.36. Minimized shading is disabled because it
removed reflectively selected scheduler implementations. A narrow source compatibility
bridge retains the old `GlobalMessageProxyHandler` ABI and existing ArrayList payload
behavior. SimpleAPI changed that ABI in `9cbde768823d09542f6909de86169a10d6360ea0`;
the bridge uses the old contract at `088b751bdc3ed50b74315aa64c4308a83288ca6a`.
It does not introduce the modern global-message wire format.

VotingPlugin shades the exact locally installed AdvancedCore jar, rather than adding its
raw transitive libraries again. This prevents Java 11/17 classes from reappearing downstream.

Bukkit and Bungee entry points are retained. Velocity sources are preserved but excluded
from the Java 8 artifact, including its descriptor and platform-specific adapters.
Although the cached Velocity API itself targeted Java 8, its 3.1.2 runtime targeted Java 11
at `ffa4c95435d1348d094d8a740ecae581c166f95b`. Current Velocity support is therefore
not claimed. The Java 8 Bungee acceptance runtime is archived Jenkins build 1485
(which reports git runtime build 1484); current build 2102 contains incompatible base classes.
This does not imply support for a current Bungee runtime on Java 8.

## Reproducible local build

Use a workspace-local Maven repository, separate from normal operator development caches:

```sh
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdk8
export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH"
mvn -B -f work/AdvancedCore-1.8/AdvancedCore/pom.xml \
  -Dmaven.resolver.transport=wagon -Dmaven.repo.local="$PWD/.m2/repository" clean install
mvn -B -f work/VotingPlugin-1.8/VotingPlugin/pom.xml \
  -Dmaven.resolver.transport=wagon -Dmaven.repo.local="$PWD/.m2/repository" clean verify
```

The coordinated dependency is `com.bencodez:advancedcore-1.8:3.7.17_1.8`, built from
this exact checkout and installed into that repository immediately before VotingPlugin.
No `LATEST`, deployment, release metadata change, or publication is required.
Final artifacts are `AdvancedCore/target/AdvancedCore.jar` and
`VotingPlugin/target/VotingPlugin.jar` respectively.

## Configuration, data and acceptance limits

No replacement of operator configuration, schema rewrite, or new proxy payload format
is introduced. Added behavior supplies defaults through existing getters and preserves
legacy signatures. The SQLite migration regression uses JDBC 3.7.2, bundled with Spigot
1.8.8, and checks repeat application with existing rows.

Unmodified baseline builds failed on dependency retrieval: the removed SimpleAPI snapshot
for AdvancedCore and a dead Velocity repository/missing AdvancedCore artifact for VotingPlugin.
These are recorded baseline failures, not passing baseline builds. The isolated candidate was
subsequently tested with Temurin 8u504 and an actual BuildTools-built Spigot 1.8.8 server.
NuVotifier 2.7.2 initialized; provider test votes exercised offline persistence, delivery on login,
online processing and rewards. Disabled sites were neither recreated nor counted. `/vote`
opened its inventory; reload and graceful shutdown completed; SQLite integrity was `ok`.

The archived Bungee runtime enabled VotingPlugin on Java 8 against an isolated loopback
MariaDB 11.8.6 database using its bundled legacy MySQL JDBC driver. NuVotifier ingress,
PLUGINMESSAGING delivery and backend rewards succeeded. One offline vote survived a
graceful proxy shutdown/restart, delivered once on login, and cleared from the JSON cache.
A backend configured with the documented shared MySQL database read the same totals;
the fixture recorded three votes and three points. This tests MariaDB interoperability,
not a separate Oracle MySQL installation or every proxy transport.
PlaceholderAPI 2.11.6 registered the VotingPlugin expansion and resolved persisted totals
and points; Vault 1.7.3 registered its permissions hook. An economy provider is absent, so
economy rewards remain unverified. A broad historical-data upgrade matrix remains unverified. These limitations must not be represented as passed runtime tests.

Modern storage/backend abstractions, current authenticated proxy transports, Control management,
Folia/Paper/Adventure features and new duration/milestone configuration systems have not been
copied wholesale. Their callers, data migrations and dependencies require separate review.
The full comparison ledger remains incomplete; these changes must not be described as matching main.

## VotingPlugin behavior backports

- Configured disabled or incomplete Vote Sites remain discoverable for identity matching,
  including legacy underscore normalization, but cannot become enabled or be recreated by
  vote receipt. The configured identity lookup itself never creates sites. Upstream: `b3505b65dda58ef86dccf6038e61819c64d50dfb` and
  `9f0f76fd9da563814bbb7c70585908aebeea4a45` (full identities are in the change ledger).
- Bungee non-voted player cache uses its actual `ProxiedPlayer` type and `getName()`;
  the existing UUID/name overload remains available.
- Java 8 packaging excludes Velocity-specific classes and metadata and retains Bukkit/Bungee.
  The stale source tree is preserved pending a separately justified migration.

No changes to external vote events, totals schemas, serialized offline rewards or existing
proxy message formats are made. Enabled sites remain filtered at the processing boundary.

Full administrator bulk-command access is configured explicitly on all legacy player-target
admin handlers; granular permissions still require their matching `.All` node. This adapts
the override integration from `6472e664dd4dd8b60d1659b9ed3bdef9d8305a82` to the old loader.

Latest coordinated validation: AdvancedCore Java 8 `clean install`: **54 unit tests + 3 artifact
integration test**, all pass. VotingPlugin Java 8 `clean verify`: **11 unit tests + 1 artifact
integration test**, all pass, using that exact isolated AdvancedCore installation.

Legacy SQLite statements and result sets now close on success, early returns and errors,
without closing the shared connection or changing legacy failure returns. SQLite player-name
lookup and update values are now bound parameters, so apostrophes remain data and SQL-looking
names cannot select another player (upstream `0f5a0477a2d38fb70732a76e46e15be6d725fe31`).
The regression tests execute against SQLite 3.7.2 and failed against the previous implementation.
This is a local old-layout adaptation, rather than adoption of the modern storage abstraction.
AdvancedCore is a library artifact with no `plugin.yml`; runtime acceptance occurs inside
VotingPlugin, which shades it, rather than independent Bukkit installation.

## Additional Java 8 runtime adaptations

SimpleAPI 0.0.7's Bungee JSON cache uses a newer static Gson parser API that is absent
from the Java 8 Bungee acceptance runtime's Gson 2.8.0. A narrow source bridge preserves
its public methods, nested cache layout and existing parsing behavior while using the
compatible parser instance methods. The bridge source is pinned to SimpleAPI
`1617356c3f026f741b5562bf62c8de59345637e1`; Gson 2.8.0 is a provided compile/test API,
not a new shaded runtime library. Nested existing-cache reload/save/reconstruction tests
run against that exact Gson API. Non-object/empty existing caches retain the old loud
initialization failure and remain byte-for-byte untouched; they are not replaced by empty
state. Malformed JSON recovery remains the inherited behavior and is not a guarantee of
recovering votes from damaged files. No cache-format migration is required.

VotingPlugin proxy shutdown now tolerates incomplete initialization while still closing
the initialized database and stopping the proxy. AdvancedCore time-checker shutdown is safe
before its timer has loaded and still stops an initialized timer. Three proxy tests cover missing proxy,
missing method/cache initialization, and database closure before the time checker exists.
This does not suppress startup failures or change normal vote routing.

Hardcoded admin/reward-editor icons use Spigot 1.8 materials. The dragon-head decorative
icon uses a skull item because 1.8 has no dragon-head material. Player-head items retain
legacy SKULL_ITEM data value 3 and the existing owner metadata. Bundled GUI defaults use
SIGN/WATCH rather than OAK_SIGN/CLOCK. Configuration keys and item purposes remain the
same; existing operator files are not replaced or automatically rewritten. Operators with
modern material names in old custom GUI files must select their 1.8 equivalents.

## MySQL bound-value backport

Upstream `f468b485e8ba17729f8288d3464df6aa0bff5097` is adapted to the fork's
existing MySQL-only table and Query APIs. Player-name/exact-row lookup, delete,
insert, and both synchronous/asynchronous update overloads bind values before
execution. Empty updates no longer execute an invalid SET statement. Table/column
identities and existing cache eviction/error-return behavior are unchanged.

Unlike newer database abstractions, this fork stores boolean values in TEXT columns
and reads them through Boolean.valueOf(String). Bound booleans therefore retain
`"true"`/`"false"` text rather than JDBC numeric boolean representation. This avoids
a data-format regression during the backport. Five focused write/dispatch tests
and two packaged read regressions cover apostrophes, SQL-looking names, boolean
format and empty updates. The read regressions execute JDBC queries through the
actual shaded Java8 dependency layout, with SQLite used for SELECT-compatible
fixtures; that is not a claim of exercising MySQL-specific write SQL on SQLite.

## Continued portable proxy backport

Upstream `e5668c862a1e4c73f1db3ec24382c70ff976791b` corrects name casing
before generating offline UUIDs. The retained Bungee implementation now uses a
connected player's canonical name; absent or disconnected players keep the
existing UTF-8 `OfflinePlayer:` algorithm. Online-mode UUID lookup and legacy
proxy payloads are unchanged. Its Velocity portion remains excluded with the
Java 8 artifact's unsupported Velocity runtime.

Three focused regressions cover connected casing, disconnected players, and the
absent-player UTF-8 fallback. The connected-casing assertion fails with the
unchanged legacy algorithm. The coordinated Java 8 `clean verify` then passes
14 unit tests and one packaged-artifact test, with no failures, errors, or skips
(`vp-offline-uuid-clean-verify.log` in the isolated workspace evidence).

The subsequent coordinated rebuild against AdvancedCore's cache scheduler fix
passes 14 unit tests and one packaged-artifact test; AdvancedCore passes 59 unit
and three packaged-artifact tests. The unchanged scheduler reproduced three
failures before its fix. No broad storage-failure durability claim follows from
that scheduler change.

Live Java8 acceptance on Spigot1.8.8 and archived Bungee1485, with NuVotifier2.7.2
and the isolated MariaDB fixture, delivered a lower-case `portproxy` vote while
`PortProxy` was connected. Proxy forwarding used the existing offline UUID. The
single matching user row remained single, and totals/points increased from4/4
to5/5; the backend and client observed the reward. Both plugins stopped cleanly,
and the temporary fixture-only OnlineMode change was restored. No class-version,
linkage, invalid-material, or SQL exception appeared in these logs. The client
placeholder query occurred before the vote and returned4/4; that is not evidence
of post-vote placeholder refresh. Proxy SQL has its own legacy table owner, so
this vote does not prove execution coverage of every AdvancedCore SQL branch.

The complete upstream ledger remains under review. These additional validated
fixes stay on the same two branches for one eventual full-scope PR per fork.
